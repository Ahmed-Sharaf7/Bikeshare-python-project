# Bikeshare-python-project
In this project, I use python to explore data related to the bike share systems for three major states in the US. The code includes libraries such as pandas and Numpy. The user shall input the city , month and day of the week on which he would like to see the bike sharing data. He can also ask the program to view raw data.
