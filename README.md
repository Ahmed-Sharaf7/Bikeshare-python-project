# Bikeshare-python-project
In this project, I use python to explore data related to the bike share systems for three major states in the US. The code includes libraries such as pandas and Numpy. The user shall input the city , month and day of the week on which he would like to see the bike sharing data. He can also ask the program to view raw data. 
The output includes the following information according to the chosen state, day and week:
- Most popular month
- Most popular day
- Most popular hour
- Most popular start station
- Most popular end station
- Most popular combination of start and end stations
- Total trip duration
- Average trip duration
- Types of users by number
- Types of users by gender (if available)
- The oldest user (if available)
- The youngest user (if available)
- The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
Then the user can choose to restart the program or not.
